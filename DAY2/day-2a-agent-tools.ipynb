Both involve using multiple agents, but they work very differently:\n\n**Agent Tools (what we're using):**\n- Agent A calls Agent B as a tool\n- Agent B's response goes **back to Agent A**\n- Agent A stays in control and continues the conversation\n- **Use case**: Delegation for specific tasks (like calculations)\n\n**Sub-Agents (different pattern):**\n- Agent A transfers control **completely to Agent B**\n- Agent B takes over and handles all future user input\n- Agent A is out of the loop\n- **Use case**: Handoff to specialists (like customer support tiers)\n\n**In our currency example:** We want the currency agent to get calculation results and continue working with them, so we use **Agent Tools**, not sub-agents.","metadata":{"id":"NuIzDxfGeBNZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 🧰 Section 4: Complete Guide to ADK Tool Types\n\nNow that you've seen tools in action, let's understand the complete ADK toolkit:\n\nIt's broadly divided into two categories: **Custom tools** and **Built-in tools**","metadata":{"id":"x06SZdbLeBNd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **1.
