    "# 🚀 Your First AI Agent: From Prompt to Action\n",
    "\n",
    "**Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Agents course!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is your first step into building AI agents. An agent can do more than just respond to a prompt — it can **take actions** to find information or get things done.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Install [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Configure your API key to use the Gemini model\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first simple agent\n",
    "- ✅ Run your agent and watch it use a tool (like Google Search) to answer a question\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‼️ Please Read\n",
    "\n",
    "> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n",
    "> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⏸️ **Note:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)\n",

Unlike traditional software that strictly follows coded instructions, AI agents can learn from data and past experiences, adapt to changing conditions, and proactively pursue objectives without constant human intervention.\n",

      "*   **Autonomy:** They can operate independently, identifying and executing the best course of action to meet goals.\n",
      "*   **Goal-Oriented:** AI agents are driven by specific objectives and strive to achieve optimal outcomes based on a performance measure.\n",
      "*   **Perception:** They gather information from their environment through sensors or digital inputs, allowing them to understand and react to their surroundings.\n",
      "*   **Reasoning and Decision-Making:** AI agents combine environmental data with domain knowledge and past context to make informed decisions.\n",
      "*   **Adaptability:** They can learn from new data and experiences, adjusting their strategies over time to improve performance.\n",
